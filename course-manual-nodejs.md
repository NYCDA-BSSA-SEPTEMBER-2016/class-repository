# NodeJS Intensive Web Development Course
*__Optimized PBL Curriculum__*

Welcome to the NodeJS course my the NYCDA. This document details the lessons you will be following over this 12 week program.

We are excited to offer you this course in a Problem Based Learning format. This will enhance both your learning experience and your eventual value as a developer in the professional realm.

It is of vital importance that you understand the Problem Based Learning format. It is therefore highly recommended that you read and revisit the introductory sections of this document regularly.

## Important note on Intensity & Prework

This course is called Web Development **Intensive**.

Dedication and hard work will be needed from everyone involved. This course will be fun, but do not forget that we are basically opening up en entire carreer path in a couple of weeks!

Be sure to do the pre-work you have been assigned. This course assumes you are familiar with:

* Basic HTML
* Basic CSS
* Basic terminal commands
* Basic website structure

# About the class schedule & structure

This section details the logistical info you need to optimally use your time with us.

## Goals of this course

Together we will help you grow in three areas:

**1. Coding skills in the backend, frontend and devops**

Specifically: NodeJS, Postgres, HTML5/CSS3, Sass, Javascript, jQuery, GitHub

**2. Self-sufficiency & rapid learning for programmers**

Programming languages go in/out of fashion. You will learn to pick up new languages and frameworks quickly so you stay relevant on the job market.

**3. Enthusiasm and a love for programming**

Programming is basically a superpower that lets you create real world-changing things by writing down things you imagined in your head in a magical language.

## The Class Schedule 

Our days will follow a structure that facilitates your learning experience. Our days together will typically take the folowing structure:

| Time    | Activity |
|---------|----------|
| 09:30   | Get settled, have coffee, play pacman
| 10:00   | PBL post-discussion ( on yesterday's pre-discussion topic )
| 11:00   | Opportunity to modify homework
| 12:00   | PBL pre-discussion ( on tomorrow's post-discussion topic )
| 13:00   | Lunchtime
| 14:00   | Lecture/demo time!
| ~~~~    | After lecture: Time to work on your post-discussion prep and exercises
| 18:00   | Class ends, homework time. You are welcome to stick around!

Please note that the pre- and post- discussions depend on your active engagement. Being prepared is a sign of respect towards your fellow students and will help you turn into a code-ninja-octocat :octocat: (costume optional).

Towards the later weeks there will be less lectures and more project centered days.

## Problem Based Learning (PBL) structure

Problem Based Learning is a learning structure that stimulates critical thinking and contextual learning. It requires more work on the student's and teacher's part, but results in far more consistent and in-depth skills.

_The short version: it will make you very competent very fast_

### Why PBL?

If you are used to the traditional system PBL might take some getting used to. It will however pay off in every aspect of your learning experience.

| System         | Learning   | Study   | Examination   |
|----------------|------------|---------|---------------|
| Traditional    | Told what you need to know | Memorize knowledge | Reproduce knowledge on exam
| PBL            | Problem assigned | Identity what needs to be learned and learn it | Apply the solution of the problem

Programming and development is a very creative skill. There are always multiple solutions to a problem, and even more styles in which to implement these solutions.

By using PBL you will not only develop programming skills, but also problem solving skills that will:

* Make you a better programmer
* Make you more valuable on the job market
* Make programming infinitely more fun

In other words:

**_Programming + PBL = :bowtie: :moneybag: :tada:_**

### The role of the teacher

| System         | Lecture approach   | Study   | Examination   |
|----------------|------------|---------|---------------|
| Traditional    | One size fits all | 'The answers are in the back' | Test knowledge
| PBL            | Personalized & interactive | Show you how to approach problems | Allow you to show off your skill

In the PBL system you collaborate closely with your teacher. Your PBL experience will be enriched with:

1. Effective lectures
2. Learning resources
3. One on one help

While your learning experience is highly individual at no point will you be alone!

### NYCDA Flavoured PBL in practice

In PBL every topic is separated into three phases:

1. Pre-discussion
2. Research & development
3. Post-discussion

Every phase in turn is separated into segments.

#### Phase 1: Pre-discussion

Session roles:
* Discussion leader - keeps the conversation professional & relevant
* Note taker        - takes notes on a public whiteboard that everyone can see
* Participant       - contributes to the discussion to the best of their ability  

Session text components:
* Text
* Recommended reading
* Exercises

Session script:

```
1. Read the session text
2. Define a problem statement
3. Brainstorm about anything and everything related to the problem statement
4. Define learning goals from the discussion
```

Note that these are **distinct phases**. That means no Learning Goals are defined during the brain storm for example.

#### Phase 2: Research & development

After the pre-discussion you will get a lecture that covers the topic you discussed beforehand. This lecture will give you the basic tools you need to tackle your learning goals and exercises.

**All learning goals are unique, the lectures will rarely cover 100% of them!**

After your lecture you have the rest of the afternoon to do additional research (for example through the recommended readings), and to use that research to complete your exercises.

_The exercises are your homework for the next day **after** lunch_

#### Phase 3: Post-discussion

The post discussion brings you all together to discuss what you discovered in the Research & Development phase.

Session roles:

* Discussion leader - keeps the conversation professional & relevant
* Note taker        - takes notes on a public whiteboard that everyone can see
* Participant       - contributes to the discussion to the best of their ability  

Session preparation:

* Find your answer to the learning goals
* Solve the exercises in your favorite way

Note: there is no single 'right' answer to the learning goals and the exercises. Most likely you will all come up with your own unique approaches.

Session script:

```
1. Share exceptional things and trouble you ran into
2. Go through the learning goals and your respective answers
3. Go through the exercises and your respective solutions
```

#### Notes and documentation

Taking notes of the pre- and post-discussions is extremely helpful. Not only will it help your learing process, but it will result your own unique summary of the entire course!

We highly recommend:

* Keeping your notes in a service like Evernote
* Making pictures of the pre- and post-discussion notes on the whiteboard

### Estimated course overview

This ia **not final** and will be subject to your teacher. It is however a general overview of what to expect.

The schedule is 5 days a week times 12 weeks is 60 days long.

# Discussion topics

The exact dates for these topics will be communicated to you durng the course.

## Values, Types and Operators

Guiding questions

* What do you recognize?
* What is a mystery to you? What could it mean?
* What do you need to know to understand this?

```js
/*
This is a piece of code
It may seem like magic
Or maybe not
*/

var apple   = 5 * 5
var success = 'Hashtag Winning'
var winner  = ['Charlie', 'Sheen']

if( apple > 20 ) {
    console.log( success )
} else if ( apple < 20 ) {
    console.log( winner[1] )
} else {
    console.log( 'Nespresso' )
}

while ( apple < 100 ) {
    console.log( 'Not enough apples' )
    apple ++
}

for ( var i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {
    console.log( 'the i is now ' + i )
}

if ( ( 5 < 10 ) || ( ( 10 == 10 ) && ( true ) ) ) {
    console.log( 'True or false, that is the question' )
}

console.log( 9 % 3 ) // 0
console.log( 9 % 4 ) // 1
console.log( 8 % 4 ) // 0
console.log( 8 % 3 ) // 2

>**Book library**
>
>Create an object that represents a book:
>
> **Part 1**
> Give it a title property with a value that is the title of your book.
> Give it a body property which has an array of strings as the value. There should be at least three strings within the array. This array represents the pages of text within your book.
> 
> **Part 2**
> Create another object with the same format, but different title and different body.
> 
> **Part 3**
> Now, create a function that *reads* the book by first printing out the title, then printing out each element (page) in the body. For a book with title "Infinite Jest" and pages "Written by David Foster Wallace", "Hal Incandenza is the youngest of the Incandenza children.", and "As a child, he was very precocious.", the output should read as follows:
> 
> ```
> Title: Infinite Jest
> Page 1: Written by David Foster Wallace
> Page 2: Hal Incandenza is the youngest of the Incandenza children.
> Page 3: As a child, he was very precocious.

## Prototypes

```js
function monster( name, type ) {
    this.name = name
    this.type = type
    this.greet = function(  ) {
        console.log( "Hello, my name is " + this.name + " and I am a " + this.type )
    }
}

var noodle = new monster( 'Flying Spaghetti Monster', 'Deity' )
var undead = new monster ( 'Jimmy', 'Zombie' )

console.log( 'The monsters in the house are: ' + noodle.name + " and " + undead.name )

noodle.greet()
undead.greet()

noodle.name = 'Anonymous'
noodle.greet()

monster.prototype.real = false

console.log( noodle.real )
console.log( undead.real )

**Exercises**

> **Prototype Practice**
> 
> - Create a new class called EmailList. The constructor function should take in one parameter, "name", and return an instance which contains the following:
>     - name, the name of the email list
>     - list, an array of all the emails in that list. Note that initially, the array will be empty.
> 
> - Add a function to the EmailList's prototype. This function should be called "addEmail", and it should take one parameter, the email address, and add it to the "list" array of the instance.
> 
> - Add another function to the prototype, called "sendEmailToAll". This function should take in one parameter: the text of the email, and then "send an email to each address". Since that lecture will be sometime in week 6, for now, simply print out the following:
> 
> ```
> "Email content:"
> <list the text of the email to be sent>
> 
> "Sending email to:"
> <list all email addresses>
> ```

Additionally:

> For the following questions, make sure to include at least two tests for each function. For now, that means calling your function with some values and printing out the answer. If you want to make Lloyd's life easier, print out the expected value as well.
> 
> ----------------------
> 
> Write a function that returns the area of a circle, given the radius.
> Hints: The area of a circle is "pi r 2". For pi, use Math.PI.
> 
> ----------------------
> 
> Given a string, create a function that returns the last character in that string.
> example:
> "cattywampus" --> "s"
> 
> ----------------------
> 
> Write a function that takes in one parameter "length" and prints out that many stars.

## Source control

```
My worst no-source-control horror was with a reasonably large PHP app. This thing was a monolithic beast - an API engine with maybe 15 files, all of which had line numbers that extended into the high tens of thousands. The level of commenting was anaemic at best, too. We'd discussed splitting it out into a more modular system, using OO to cut back on a lot of the duplication, but management (as always) didn't see the benefit of spending a month on the task.

We only had a few devs, and each had a copy of the whole project on their disk. Every time a change was to be pushed, we downloaded a copy of the lead dev's source (his live development code) and used diff to identify the changes, then updated them manually. Line by line. All by hand. The merged source was put it on his shared drive, along with our colleagues' copies. Before each test release, he'd go through all of the uploaded copies and merge them into a master branch. Usually it'd take a few iterations of diff-and-edit before we got a solid copy.

Of course, once we started hiring more devs, this process got more interesting. We had sub-teams, where each team leader had to merge to a team branch, which would then be merged with the master branch by the team leader. Line by line. All by hand. Ad infinitum.

## NodeJS

```
Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

## NodeJS Modules

Filestructure:
- node-modules
.gitignore
app.js
sayhello.js

app.js:

```js
var express = require( 'express' )
var sayhello = require( './sayhello' )

sayhello( process.argv[2] ) // Hello my name is Peter
```

sayhello.js:

```js
var greeter = function ( name ) {
    console.log( 'Hello, I am ' + name )
}
module.exports = greeter
```

Start commend for app:

```
node app.js Peter

**Exercise**
> Country Information App
> 
> **Part 1**
> Create a Node.js application that does the following:
> - Takes in one parameter from the command line, the name of a country. Note: command line arguments can be read from the global array `process.argv`
> - Reads and parses the `countries.json` file. Note: you must use readFile and not readFileSync.
> - Outputs information about that specific country. Must be in the following format:
>     Country: <country name>
>     Top Level Domain: <tld>
> 
> **Part 2**
> - For the purposes of this exercise, you must create a separate module for reading and parsing the JSON file, named "json-file-reader".
> - This module should have a function that takes in a filename and a callback function as a parameter. It should then read that file, then parse the JSON. Finally, it should call the callback function and pass the parsed JSON to it.
> - One way to think of this module is as a helper that can read and parse any JSON file. It has nothing to do with 'countries', so to speak.
> - Another way to think of it is as a small wrapper to fs.readFile, except that this function only works with JSON files.
> 
> Hints:
> - Use JSON.parse (https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse (Links to an external site.)) to parse JSON data from files into a JavaScript object.
> - Try first completing the assignment without creating a separate module - Extracting the second module out is significantly more difficult.

## cURL

> // GET request
> 
> ```bash
> curl -v example.com
> ```
> 
> // POST request
> 
> ```bash
> curl -v --data "param1=value1&param2=value2" example.com/resource.cgi
> ```
> 
> // GET request with headers
> 
> ```bash
> curl -v example.com --header "Content-Type:application/json"
> ```
> 
> 
> // pecify http command with -X
> 
> ```bash
> # the following two are the same:
> curl example.com
> curl -X GET example.com
> ```

**Exercise**

> **Important Notes**
> - Remember to add "node_modules" to your .gitignore file. Otherwise, a lot of other people's code is going to end up in your repository.
> - If you did not originally create the repo, you must "fork" it on github, which will make a copy and put it on your github.
> - express.static() looks for 'index.html' by default, so rename your home page to that. Alternatively, serve a different default file using the following syntax:
> 
> ```js
> app.use(express.static('myStaticPath', {
>     index: 'myNonDefaultHomepage.html'
> }));
> ```
> 
> **Instructions**
> - Take the website that you built previously, and create a new branch on git so the old version is still available for grading / reviewing.
> - Put your website on a Node.js server, so that it can be reached at http://localhost:3000.
> - Your Node.js server does not need any routes, since the entire website is static content.
> - Check each of your links and images to ensure that they still work.
> - Express by default looks for `index.html` for the first page.

**Exercise**

> **User Information App - Web Server**
> 
> Create a Node.js application that is the beginning of a user management system. Your users are all saved in a "users.json" file, and you can currently do the following:
> - search for users
> - add new new users to your users file.
> 
> **Part 0**
> Create one route:
> - route 1: renders a page that displays all your users.
> 
> **Part 1**
> Create two more routes:
> - route 2: renders a page that displays a form which is your search bar.
> - route 3: takes in the post request from your form, then displays matching users on a new page. Users should be matched based on whether either their first or last name contains the input string.
> 
> **Part 2**
> Create two more routes:
> - route 4: renders a page with three forms on it (first name, last name, and email) that allows you to add new users to the users.json file.
> - route 5: takes in the post request from the 'create user' form, then adds the user to the users.json file. Once that is complete, redirects to the route that displays all your users (from part 0).

## AJAX

var menuId = $( "ul.nav" ).first().attr( "id" );
var request = $.ajax({

  dataType: "html"
});
 
request.done(function( msg ) {
  $( "#log" ).html( msg );
});
 
request.fail(function( jqXHR, textStatus ) {
  alert( "Request failed: " + textStatus );
});

$("button").click(function(){
    $.get("demo_test.asp", function(data, status){
        alert("Data: " + data + "\nStatus: " + status);
    });
});

$("button").click(function(){
    $.post("demo_test_post.asp",
    {
        name: "Donald Duck",
        city: "Duckburg"
    },
    function(data, status){
        alert("Data: " + data + "\nStatus: " + status);
    });
});

**Exercise**

> **User Information App - AJAX Server**
> 
> Starting with your previous website, create a new branch to preserve the old site.
> Your site has a form on it that acts like a search bar. On click, it should retrieve a list of matching users and list them by name on the same page, similar to how the search bars on airbnb.com or hipmunk.com function.
> 
> Hints:
> - use https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/indexOf
> - you cannot send or render a response more than once per request.
> - you must find a way to capture whenever the user's input changes in the search bar. This will trigger your Ajax request to your server.
> 
> **Part 0: If you're having trouble finding matching users, solve this puzzle first:**
> 
> ```js
> // given an array of values, write a function that finds the index of where the value is located, and if nothing is found, returns -1.
> // example: for ['apple', 'orange', 'pineapple']
> // 'orange' returns '1'
> // 'durian' returns '-1'
> 
> // now, write a function that finds all the indexes of where the value is located and returns them in an array, and if nothing is found, returns -1
> // example: ['apple', 'orange', 'orange', 'pineapple']
> // 'orange' returns [1,2]
> ```
> 
> **Part 1: Autocomplete**
> Modify your form so that every time the user enters a key, it makes an AJAX call that populates the search results.
> Do this work in a git branch called "autocomplete". Then, merge this branch into master with a pull request.
> 
> **Part 2: Bandwidth optimization**
> Modify your form again so that AJAX requests happen at most once every 300 milliseconds.
> Do this work in a git branch called "bandwidth-optimization". Then, merge this branch into master with a pull request.
> 
> Hints:
> - use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/now
> - test it by opening the Network tab in Chrome's Developer Tools by checking that fewer requests are going off.

**Exercise**

> **Bulletin Board Application**
> Create a website that allows people to post messages to a page. A message consists of a title and a body.
> The site should have two pages:
> - The first page shows people a form where they can add a new message.
> - The second page shows each of the messages people have posted.
> Make sure there's a way to navigate the site so users can access each page.
> 
> Messages must be stored in a postgres database. Create a "messages" table with three columns:
> column name / column data type:
> 
> - id: serial primary key
> - title: text
> - body: text
> 
> **Additional Grading Criteria**
> 
> As before, your package.json must include the correct dependencies.
> 
> Additionally, you must configure postgres as follows:
> Name your database "bulletinboard".
> Your postgres username must be read from an environment variable named "POSTGRES_USER".
> Your postgres password (if present) must be read from an environment variable named "POSTGRES_PASSWORD"
> 
> Thus, your connection string in the code will appear as follows:
> 
> ```
> var connectionString = 'postgres://' + process.env.POSTGRES_USER + ':' + process.env.POSTGRES_PASSWORD + '@localhost/bulletinboard';
> ```
> 
> set an environment variable by opening either ~/.bash_profile for OSX or ~/.bashrc for Linux and adding the line:
> 
> ```
> export POSTGRES_USER=jon
> export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword
> ```
> 
> After that, restart your terminal to propagate these changes to your shell.
> 
> This will allow your assignments to be graded without having to go into your code and change your connection string to his configuration.

## Promises

```js
var promise = Promise.resolve('hello')
.then(function(str) {
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
      setTimeout(function() {
        resolve(`${str} there`);
    }, 1000);
});
})
.then(function(str) {
    return `${str} world!`;
})
.then(function(str) {
    //prints "hello there world!"
    console.log(str);
    //the `promise` variable above will eventually
    //be a fulfilled promise with `str` as its value
    return Promise.resolve(str);
});

  // About sequelize
  var Sequelize = require('sequelize');
  var sequelize = new Sequelize('postgres://user:password@localhost/my_db');

//use the same hat definition as before
var Hat = sequelize.define('hat', {
    name: Sequelize.STRING,
    material: Sequelize.STRING,
    height: Sequelize.INTEGER,
    brim: Sequelize.BOOLEAN
});

//define a simple person model
var Person = sequelize.define('person', {
    name: Sequelize.STRING
});

//a person can have many hats...
Person.hasMany(Hat);
//... but a hat belongs to a single person.
Hat.belongsTo(Person);

sequelize
    //sync the models
    .sync()
    .then(function(){
        //then create a person
        //turns into INSERT INTO "people" ("id", "name") VALUES (DEFAULT, 'Jane Smith')
        return Person.create({

        //  VALUES (DEFAULT, 'cowboy', 'straw', 3, true, 1) RETURNING *;
        return person.createHat({
            name: 'cowboy',
            material: 'straw',

> **ORM-Lite module**
> 
> Create a module called `orm-lite` that gives a user the following functions to work with:
> - A function named `initialize` that takes in a connection string as a parameter. Save this to a global variable so that later function calls can connect to the designated postgres database.
> - A function named `getAll` that takes the name of a table as a parameter, as well as a 'callback' parameter. The function should connect to the postgres database and get the contents of that table in an array. Invoke the callback with the table contents.
> - A function named `findById` that behaves similarly to `getAll` above, except that it additionally accepts an 'id' parameter. It should retrieve the row specified by the id and send it to the callback. 
> 
> 
> Secondly, test this module:
> First, in psql, create a table:
> 
> ```
> create table test_user (
>     id        serial primary key,
>     firstname text,
>     lastname  text
> );
> ```
> 
> Now add a few entries to the table:
> 
> ```
> insert into test_user (firstname, lastname) values
>     ('jackson', 'pollock'),
>     ('sylvia', 'plath'),
>     ('daenerys', 'targaryen');
> ```
> 
> Now, create an application that firstly requires the `orm-lite` module, then calls each of its methods, then prints the output. This will allow you to see that everything is in order.
> 
> **Bonus: Prototype practice**
> 
> Create a `Table` class. The class should take in the name of a table in the constructor and the connection string and add them to the `this` object. Now, attach a `getAll()` function attached to its prototype. The `getAll()` function should now read the table name from `this`'s table name property.
> In other words, `getAll("user")` would become `User.getAll()`.
> Do the same for `findById`.
> 
> In this manner, users of your module can create instances of your class that represent their tables, which will automatically have methods on them that allow data retrieval from those tables.

## Cookies & Sessions

**Exercise**

> Add encryption to your blog application so that your user's passwords are stored safely. Do this in a new branch called "encryption", then merge this back into your main branch.
> 
> Use the "bcrypt" library, and see: https://github.com/j7caiman/nodejs-sample-apps/tree/master/bcrypt_example for an example on how to use it.
> 
> Aside: Remember to use the input of type "password" so that the form field will appear as "*****" - otherwise, people looking over the shoulders of your users' screens will be able to steal their passwords.

## Relational database structures

**Exercise**

> Consider this scenario:
> You are building an application that connects people who want to learn languages with each other. Each user is fluent in at least one language, and is trying to learn at least one other language. Your application matches compatible users with one another so that through an exchange, they can teach each other the languages they are good at.
> 
> Your matching algorithm is as follows:
> 
> For a user who is fluent in language X and wants to learn how to speak language Y, match them with all the users who are fluent in language Y and desire to speak language X.
> Note that users can be fluent in multiple languages, and can also desire to learn multiple languages.
> For example, say your site has the following users:
> - Iris:    fluent in English and Spanish | wants to learn French and German
> - Finn:    fluent in German              | wants to learn Spanish
> - Nathan:  fluent in French              | wants to learn English and Spanish
> - Natasha: fluent in English             | wants to learn Mandarin
> 
> When Iris signs on, she'll be matched with Finn and Nathan.
> When Finn or Nathan sign on, they'll be matched with Iris.
> Natasha will not be matched with anyone until the site has more users.
> 
> Part 1:
> You currently have two tables: Users and Languages. Draw a diagram that describes how you will store users' desired languages and users' fluent languages, including any added tables you need, as well as those tables' columns.
> 
> Part 2:
> When a user logs on to your site, describe the algorithm you will use to match that user with other users. Starting with the current user's id, how will you fetch his desired and fluent languages? What will you do after that?

## Frontend frameworks
